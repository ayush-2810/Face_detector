# Face_detector
This repository uses opencv to detect the face.


opencv is a python module used for detecting various objects. It is also used for detecting various features of faces like eyes, nose, etc.  

In this repo I have used opencv for detecting face itself.  

It uses haarcascade_frontalface_default as a classifier which is used for detecting faces.
